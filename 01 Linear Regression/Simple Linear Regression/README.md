# Salary Dataset - Simple Linear Regression
## INTRODUCTION
- In this project we will working with the Salary Dataset from Kaggle which is designed for applying Simple Linear Regression. 
- The primary goal is to understand the relationship between years of experience and salary allowing us to predict the expected salary for an individual based on their years of experience.
- Simple Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and important statistical methods in machine learning. It involves finding a linear relationship between two variables: an independent variable and dependent variable.
-- In this case "YearsExperience" is the independent variable, and "Salary" is the dependent variable.
